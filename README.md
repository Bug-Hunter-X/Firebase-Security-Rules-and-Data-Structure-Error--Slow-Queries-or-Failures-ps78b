# Firebase Security Rules and Data Structure Error
This repository demonstrates a common Firebase error related to inefficient data querying due to improper data structuring and indexing within subcollections. The example showcases a query that fails because of how the data is structured within the database. The solution provides a better approach.

## Problem
The original code attempts to query documents in a subcollection based on a nested field within each document (`author.uid`).  Without proper indexing for this nested field, the query becomes inefficient and might fail. This is a common error, especially when dealing with complex data structures.

## Solution
The solution involves restructuring the data to improve query performance and using the correct indexing strategies within Firebase. The refactored code uses a more efficient data structure, avoiding the nested field access in the query.
